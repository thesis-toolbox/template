## Quickstart

A good starting point for your exploration of the template is `main.tex` since it includes and calls all the other files consecutively.
Detailed instruction and backgrounds are given as comments directly inside the tex-files.

If you want to use the given Makefile, just use the `make` command to build the pdf and `make clean` to clean up the directory again.
For information about more advanced commands try `make help`.

## FAQ, Problems and Workarounds

This section is a collection of the most frequent problems during the usage of this template and potential solutions.

### How do I set up my own git repo to be able to install updates on the template?

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to keep connected with the main repo.
For the most simple usage, you can just ignore all changes to the template.
Just copy all files here once and start your own git repo from scratch.

If you are a more advanced git user, you can try the following:

```sh
# Just set up an empty git repo, e.g. by
git init

# Add a remote link to this template git repo
git remote add template https://github.com/thesis-toolbox/template
```

```sh
### Repeat the following two commands whenever you want to do an update

# Get a local copy of the most recent version of the template
git fetch template master
# Merge all the template changes into your master. Maybe you have to fix some conflicts.
git merge template/master

# If this command is aborted with 'fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories' try this
git merge template/master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### TeXstudio does not compile my bibliography!

This bug is caused by TeXstudio missing another round of compilation including the bibliography in the final document.
Go to: `Options -> Configure TeXstudio... -> build -> Build&View -> Click on the Screw-Driver -> Cancel`
Then, put the following string into corresponding text field:

```sh
txs:///compile | txs:///bibliography | txs:///compile | txs:///view
```

If you still experience problems or weird error messages, please try using biber.

### TeXstudio has a broken navigation!

Most likely you have not enabled the necessary crawlers.
Go to: `Options -> Configure TeXstudio... -> Completion` and check `biblatex.cwl` and `subfiles.cwl` and whatever else you need.

Close and reopen TeXstudio to fully reload the config if needed.

### Some referenced files are not found - is their path wrong?

```
LaTeX Warning: File `./img/SomeName.pdf' not found on input line SomeLine.

! Package pdftex.def Error: File `./img/SomeName.pdf' not found: using draft setting.
```

Unfortunately, different versions of the subfiles package used in the template require different logics for the provided path name.
This template is configured for the most recent version, but thereby will fail for older versions.
Several of these error messages most likely indicate that your system is using and outdated version.
If you cannot update the LaTeX-Packages in your system, you can try the following workaround:

Copy this file into your main directory [subfiles.sty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsalzer/subfiles/1.6/subfiles.sty)
